    <h2>How do I comment on a post?</h2>

    <p>Try this keyboard combination very slowly. [Down Arrow], [Period], [Enter]. Don't over do it. Instagram has limits on how quickly you post comments. Use the [Up Arrow] to mark posts that you like and the [Down Arrow] to comment on posts that you really like.</p>

    <h2>Commenting still doesn't work, what else could be wrong?</h2>

    <p>The commenting feature relies on the word "comment" being found on the page. If you are using Instagram in a language other than English try switching to English at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>How do I enter my license code?</h2>

    <p>Click the Magis icon, select *Options*, then *License Number*. Paste your license number from the email you received. Make sure there are no spaces before or after the code. You will not get a confirmation but you should no longer see the alert asking you to buy.</p>
