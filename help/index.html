    <h1>Magis Questions & Answers</h1>
    
    <p>Below are a few common questions and answers. These are here to provide you quick answers; they are not meant to discourage you from contacting me directly. Feel free to <a href="mailto:joel@joeldare.com">email me</a> with any comments or questions.</p>

    <h2>How do I comment on a post?</h2>

    <p>Try this keyboard combination very slowly. [Down Arrow], [Period], [Enter]. Don't over do it. Instagram has limits on how quickly you post comments. Use the [Up Arrow] to mark posts that you like and the [Down Arrow] to comment on posts that you really like.</p>

    <h2>Commenting still doesn't work, what else could be wrong?</h2>

    <p>The commenting feature relies on the word "comment" being found on the page. If you are using Instagram in a language other than English try switching to English at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>How do I enter my license code?</h2>

    <p>Click the Magis icon, select <em>Options</em>, then <em>License Number</em>. Paste your license number from the email you received. Make sure there are no spaces before or after the code. You will not get a confirmation but you should no longer see the alert asking you to buy.</p>

    <h2>How do I disable the reminders?</h2>

    <p>Click the Magis icon, select <em>Options</em>, then <em>Hourly Activty Reminders</em>. Put an 'x' into the field. No reminders will appear.</p>

    <h2>I'm not seeing reminders, what do I do?</h2>

    <p>By default, Magis shows a badge on the icon and makes a short sound reminding you to use Social Media twice an hour. If you aren't seeing or hearing reminders, click the Magis icon, select *Options*, then *Hourly Activty Reminders*. Delete anything in the box.</p>
